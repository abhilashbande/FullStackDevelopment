            Australians all let us rejoice, For we are one and free; We’ve
            golden soil and wealth for toil; Our home is girt by sea; Our land
            abounds in nature’s gifts Of beauty rich and rare; In history’s
            page, let every stage Advance Australia Fair. In joyful strains then
            let us sing, Advance Australia Fair. Beneath our radiant Southern
            Cross We’ll toil with hearts and hands; To make this Commonwealth of
            ours Renowned of all the lands; For those who’ve come across the
            seas We’ve boundless plains to share; With courage let us all
            combine To Advance Australia Fair. In joyful strains then let us
            sing, Advance Australia Fair.
