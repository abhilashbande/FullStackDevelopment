                            The Dassault Rafale (French pronunciation: ​[ʁafal],
                            literally meaning "gust of wind", and "burst of
                            fire" in a more military sense) is a French
                            twin-engine, canard delta wing, multirole fighter
                            aircraft designed and built by Dassault Aviation.
                            Equipped with a wide range of weapons, the Rafale is
                            intended to perform air supremacy, interdiction,
                            aerial reconnaissance, ground support, in-depth
                            strike, anti-ship strike and nuclear deterrence
                            missions. The Rafale is referred to as an "omnirole"
                            aircraft by Dassault.

                            "balalaika", because its planform resembles the
                            stringed musical instrument of the same name;
                            "Ołówek", Polish for "pencil", due to the shape of
                            its fuselage, and "Én Bạc", meaning "silver

                            Developed by Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL),
                            with Kurt Tank as lead designer. The Project
                            Engineer from HAL was George William Benjamin. It is
                            the first Indian-developed jet aircraft, and the
                            first Asian jet fighter (outside Russia/Soviet
                            Union) to go beyond the test phase and into
                            successful production and active service. On 17 June
                            1961, the type conducted its maiden flight; on 1
                            April 1967, the first production Marut was
                            officially delivered to the IAF.

                            manufactured by Dassault Aviation. It was designed
                            in the late 1970s as a lightweight fighter to
                            replace the Mirage III for the French Air Force
                            (Armée de l'air). The Mirage 2000 evolved into a
                            multirole aircraft with several variants developed,
                            with sales to a number of nations. It was later
                            developed into the Mirage 2000N and 2000D strike
                            variants, the improved Mirage 2000-5, and several
                            export variants. Over 600 aircraft were built and it
                            has been in service with nine nations.

                            aircraft designed in the Soviet Union. Developed by
                            the Mikoyan design bureau as an air superiority
                            fighter during the 1970s, the MiG-29, along with the
                            larger Sukhoi Su-27, was developed to counter new
                            U.S. fighters such as the McDonnell Douglas F-15
                            Eagle and the General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon.
                            The MiG-29 entered service with the Soviet Air
                            Forces in 1982.

                            While originally oriented towards combat against any
                            enemy aircraft, many MiG-29s have been furnished as
                            multirole fighters capable of performing a number of
                            different operations, and are commonly outfitted to
                            use a range of air-to-surface armaments and
                            precision munitions. The MiG-29 has been
                            manufactured in several major variants, including
                            the multirole Mikoyan MiG-29M and the navalised
                            Mikoyan MiG-29K; the most advanced member of the
                            family to date is the Mikoyan MiG-35. Later models
                            frequently feature improved engines, glass cockpits
                            with HOTAS-compatible flight controls, modern radar
                            and infrared search and track (IRST) sensors, and
                            considerably increased fuel capacity; some aircraft
                            have also been equipped for aerial refueling.

                            Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the
                            militaries of a number of former Soviet republics
                            have continued to operate the MiG-29, the largest of
                            which is the Russian Air Force. The Russian Air
                            Force wanted to upgrade its existing fleet to the
                            modernised MiG-29SMT configuration, but financial
                            difficulties have limited deliveries. The MiG-29 has
                            also been a popular export aircraft; more than 30
                            nations either operate or have operated the aircraft
                            to date. As of 2013 the MiG-29 was still in
                            production by Mikoyan, a subsidiary of United
                            Aircraft Corporation (UAC) since 2006.

                            wing, light multirole fighter designed by the
                            Aeronautical Development Agency (ADA) in

                            for the Indian Air Force and Indian Navy. It came
                            from the Light Combat Aircraft (LCA) programme,
                            which began in the 1980s to replace India's ageing
                            MiG-21 fighters but later became part of a general
                            fleet modernisation programme. In 2003, the LCA was
                            officially named "Tejas". It is the smallest and
                            lightest in its class of contemporary supersonic
                            combat aircraft.
